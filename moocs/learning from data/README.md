## The Learning Problem

Sometimes, because we don't have any analytical solution to our problem we need to use data. Think about that is a tree? Do you need this information or just recognize one?

### 1.1 Problem Setup

#### [1.1. 1 Components of Learning ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UkSEPbnI7ECT5AvGhm0An34bpzHvjj-3?usp=sharing)

The metaphor we'll use for de Learning Problem will be Credit Approval. Let's imagine that a bank wants to know if a specific client is worth to borrow money from them. Let's name our componets.
- x user info (INPUT)
- f. X  -> Y: The target function, a function that predict if the customer will pay back the bank.
- D: Dataset (per (xn, yn)
- yn = f(xn) for n = 1, ..., N (number of inputs)
- g: X -> Y (function that aproximates f (Algorithm)

#### 1. 1.2 A Simple Learning Model 

Differente of the data and of the target function the hipoteshis `H` is our choose. Also, we can call the hipoteshis, **the learning model**.
