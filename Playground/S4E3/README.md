# Overview
Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal**: Predict the probability of various defects on steel plates. 

# Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using area under the ROC curve using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.
To calculate the final score, AUC is calculated for each of the 7 defect categories and then averaged. In other words, the score is the average of the individual AUC of each predicted column.

# About the Tabular Playground Series
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.
